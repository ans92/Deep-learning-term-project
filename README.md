# Art Visual Question Answering

### Deep Learning Term Project

This is the term project that I did for my Deep Learning course. I presented the paper in the class, reproduced the results and also written the report. Please note that I am not the original author or co-author of this paper. For original paper please go to this [Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.12520.pdf)  

#### Project Summary

The paper introduces AQUA (Art Question Answering), a new dataset based on paintings and meta information, and a model VIKING, that answers related questions.
